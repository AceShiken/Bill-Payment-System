We at Setu believe that to build a solution, you must experience the problem first hand. As one
of Setuâ€™s products caters to an ecosystem of billers, we expect you to be a biller first before
you can be a part of Setu.
Using this test we want to check your abilities to:
1. Code and build an API system
2. Host the API system
3. Understand API documentation
4. Use postman to test the APIs
5. Understand software systems and the web
Build a Setu compatible bill payment system
Your bill system should maintain a small DB of customers and their bills. Then expose 2 APIs
to be able to do the following:
1. Allow for a fetching a bill
2. Allow payment update against a bill and fetch receipt
The biller system APIs need to be consumable by a UPI app like PhonePe. This guide explains
how you can build the said APIs: https://hackmd.io/@ranjth-setu/r1rVE0Y28
Submission guidelines
1. Host your biller APIs at a URL so that we can access it and test it
2. Submit the following 5 items over email:
a. Link to the public github/gitlab repository for the source code of your biller
system
b. URL of your API
c. API key
d. At least 5 sets of sample test data for the bill fetch API
e. Working postman collection which we can import and test your APIs
Evaluation guide
Steps:
1. Fetch bill: We will query your system to fetch a bill for a given customer identifier.
2. Update Payment: We will call your update-payment API and post information about a
payment.
3. Fetch bill: We will fetch a bill with the same customer identifier. The expectation is that
the payment is reflected in your system.
4. Update payment would be called multiple times to check if the API is idempotent.
Criteria:
1. Proper error handling, error codes and messages.
2. Follow the docs word to word. Any deviation from the required spec will result in
disqualification.
